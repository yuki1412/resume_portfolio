This is a record on what I had learned

## Text Mining

### [Natural Language Processing]()

## Web Scraping Technique

Web scraping which also known as web harvesting or web data extraction. It is a technique to extract information/data from the Web/Internet.


### By Using BeautifulSoup in Python

With the help of BeautifulSoup library, it is easier to do HTML parsing. [Data Extraction on The Star news website](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yuki1412/self_learning/blob/master/Web_Scraping_using_BeautifulSoup.ipynb)
